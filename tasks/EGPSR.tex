\section{Enhanced General Purpose Service Robot}
\label{test:egpsr}
The robot is asked to find problems in the arena on its own and solve them.


\noindent \textbf{Main Goal:} Solve 3(5?) problems in the arena.\\

\noindent \textbf{Optional Goals:}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Maybe move furniture?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Setup}
Generally assume that the arena is supposed to be in its default state. Therefore, possible problems to solve are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Problems:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Objects:} Objects that are not in their default location should be returned there. Objects on the floor are to be thrown in the trash.
			\item \textbf{Persons:} Any person inside the arena other than the referee and referee assistant have a command for the robot and can be approached.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item \textbf{Partial scoring:} The main task allows partial scoring (per \emph{solved} problem).

	\item \textbf{Command generator:} Problems and commands will be generated using TODO.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Referee instructions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Setup the problems in the arena.
	\item Provide commands to volunteers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{OC instructions}

2h before the test:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate the problems and commands (don't reveal them to the teams!).
	\item Recruit volunteers to assist during the test.
\end{itemize}
