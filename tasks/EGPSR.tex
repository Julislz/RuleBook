\subsection*{Setup}
Generally assume that the arena is supposed to be in its default state. Therefore, possible problems to solve are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Problems:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Objects:} Objects that are not in their default location should be returned there. Objects on the floor are to be thrown in the trash or returned to their default location.
			\item \textbf{Persons:} Some persons in the arena will have requests for the robot. They will raise their hand if the robot is in the same room.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Referee instructions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Setup the problems in the arena.
	\item Provide commands to volunteers.
\end{itemize}
